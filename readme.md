# Connect Four

This was a program I worked on during summer break as an undergraduate student. The program has a multiplayer and singleplayer option. While working on the singleplayer portion of the program, it introduced me to the world of artificial intelligence through the implementation of the minimax algorithm. Seeing the AI autonomously fight against human players on a high level was exciting to see. While working on the multiplayer functionality, it introduced me to socket programming.

The code for the minimax algorithm is not originally mine. While researching the minimax algorithm, I came across KeithGalli's python implementation for the minimax algorithm and used it as a reference for the singleplayer portion of my program.

Original Code for MiniMax Algorithm: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python.git

To run the program to play singleplayer:
  1) Download the zip file.
  2) Unzip the file into a folder.
  3) Open the "main.py" file.
